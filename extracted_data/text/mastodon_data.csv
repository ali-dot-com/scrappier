"Taylor Lorenz","@taylorlorenz","Meta is downranking/hiding political content on Threads. The company says Threads will “not recommend any content/accounts that post about politics.” Here’s the issue: what counts as “politics” is often any news abt people who have had their whole existence politicized, such as news about Black people, LGBTQ people, disabled ppl, women, etc. Climate scientists, public health experts etc also considered “political” https://www.axios.com/2024/02/09/meta-political-content-moderation-threads"
"Andrea Junker","@Strandjunker@mstdn.social","Trump stole documents on confidential informants in January 2021 and 9 months later CIA Counterintelligence sent a top secret cable warning an unusually high number of confidential informants had been killed, captured, or compromised. I feel like more people should mention that."

"Laffy","@GottaLaff","Guess what. I'm in a very shitty, blocky mood today. Come into my feed and tell me we need a new candidate? Bye. Start kvetching and playing into their hands by indulging in the ""He's too old"" crap. See ya. Whine about our 2 party system when right now we need to be fighting our asses off for democracy and supporting our candidates? #Toodles. This is NOT the day to test my patience. Don't believe me? Wanna provoke? I will block, no matter who you are."

"Bit ░ Nova :","@cmdr_nova@mkultra.monster","The next in my Decay Theory series of articles for Atlas Obscura just went up today! In this article I cover why preservation of endangered buildings is so critical and why it can make such a difference to a community - far from only being memorials to sentimentality, historic structures that are repurposed also can provide a substantial economic boost. Check it out! https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/column-preservation-of-abandoned-places"

"Abandoned America","@AbandonedAmerica","one of the more scary effects of medicating my adhd is realizing just how much I was driven by stress and the sum of scattered thoughts I feel relaxed for the first time in years  it's making me feel okay not pushing myself to be productive during every single waking moment I'm extremely thankful for this, because it's exactly what I need to do to get out of my burnout, but it also makes me feel, scared, that I'm feeling okay not being productive?"
